## Compilation 

### Install

``` 
sudo apt-get install mingw-w64
```

### Pre-Compiled Headers

```
x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ -x c++-header -o pch.h.gch pch.h
```

### Compilation Steps (Not Including The Fast One)

```
x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ -O2 -static -msse4.2 -c CHOSEN_COMPRESSION.cpp -o CHOSEN_COMPRESSION.o

x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ -O2 -static -msse4.2 -c main.cpp -o main.o    

x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ -static -msse4.2 -o CHOSEN_EXE_NAME.exe CHOSEN_COMPRESSION.o main.o
```


### Compilation Steps for The Fast One

First we run the python script to get the solution in a txt file, for example pyout.txt:

```
python3 comp.py < the_fast_one.csv > pyOut.txt
```

Then we create a header file of the txt file:

```
xxd -i pyOut.txt > pyOut_txt.h
```

Then general compilation: 

```
x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ -O2 -static -msse4.2 -c fastOne.cpp -o fastOne.o

x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ -static -msse4.2 -o CHOSEN_EXE_NAME.exe fastOne.o
```



### Compilation Steps for System Speed Exploit for The Intro One

This program runs off of a MakeFile, move the Main.cpp and the pre-compiled headers into the same directory and then run:

```
Make
```
